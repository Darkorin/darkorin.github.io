## Deployment Link
https://darkorin.github.io/

## Description
My personal website that houses my project portfolio as well as links to various professional materials about myself.
It consists of a home page with my picture and a few icon links;
a project page which contains screenshots and links to a few of my projects and their repos;
and an about page which has my github, linkedin, resume, email, and phone number listed.

I included a button to toggle an alternate Dark Theme for the website.
